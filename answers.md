## Question 1

variable = 'variable' 

integer = 1

string = 'blah blah blah' 

floats = 1,5

## Question 2  
```
cars
=> []                          ^
car1 = {wheels: 4, max_speed: 50, color: 'orange' }
car1
=> {:wheels=>4, :max_speed=>50, :color=>"orange"}

car2 = {wheels: 4, max_speed: 300, color: 'blue'}
car2
=> {:wheels=>4, :max_speed=>300, :color=>"blue"}

cars = [car1, car2]
cars
=> [{:wheels=>4, :max_speed=>50, :color=>"orange"}, {:wheels=>4, :max_speed=>300, :color=>"blue"}]
=> {:wheels=>4, :max_speed=>300, :color=>"blue"}

cars[1][:color]
=> "blue"
```

## Question 4

Running the tests maked it easier to write code as the error guide you to the solution.

Helps finding the errors and fixing them
